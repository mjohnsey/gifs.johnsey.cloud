# gifs.johnsey.cloud

This is a place to store all my favorite gifs that I want to have close at hand.

## How to add gifs

You can add gifs by adding them to the gifs folder and opening a PR. A GH Action will take care of wiring it to the index page for you and then on merge it will automatically re-deploy.
